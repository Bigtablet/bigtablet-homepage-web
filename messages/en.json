Once I’m interested in something, I study and learn until I truly understand it. Looking back, my early start in the professional world, combined with this curiosity-driven mindset, has shaped who I am today. It’s also what has allowed me to work with Bigtablet for the past three years without giving up until problems were solved."

            "q": "What inspired you to start your own company?",
            "a": "Many people think entrepreneurship is only for experts in a specific field or those with a revolutionary idea. For me, it was more about identifying problems and finding fulfillment in solving them. Seeing the company grow as a result of our collective efforts has been deeply rewarding. That’s why I no longer see Bigtablet as just a company I founded in college, but as a true partner in solving real-world challenges."

Of course, our employee benefits are also quite nice!"

At BigTablet, I lead the development of our AI CCTV solutions and various R&D initiatives, managing both internal and external collaborative projects. I’m also in charge of technical administration such as preparing R&D proposals, writing reports, and handling intellectual property. In essence, a CTO bridges technology and business strategy to drive company growth."

          "qa3": {
            "q": "Could you tell us a bit about what you’re currently developing at BigTablet?",
            "a": "We’re developing a platform for video AI analytics based on VCM — Video Coding for Machines. Traditional video compression focuses on what’s visually pleasing to humans, while we’re building compression optimized for AI interpretation. Our system preserves high resolution for objects of interest while reducing unnecessary background data, redundant frames, and excessive color information. This allows us to cut video size by up to 70% compared to standard codecs, while maintaining object detection and tracking accuracy. With this technology, we’re expanding into fields like smart retail and smart city solutions."

          "qa4": {
            "q": "It must have been challenging to develop products in the early stages. What difficulties did you face?",
            "a": "Coming from a research background, joining BigTablet was my first hands-on experience in real product development. Unlike academic research, we had to design for user interface and experience, which turned out to be quite challenging. While improving algorithm performance was familiar to me, making it intuitive and usable for real users required many iterations. In the early days, limited resources and manpower meant I had to juggle development, operation, and testing at once. Prioritization and efficiency became critical. Through this, I learned to think beyond technical perfection — considering productization and market fit together."

          "qa3": {
            "q": "Was there a particular reason or moment that led you to join Bigtablet?",
            "a": "There wasn’t really a grand reason or turning point. Before graduation, I was looking for companies to do my field training at, and Bigtablet happened to be close by. But what really drew me was that the CEO was young — I thought other places might feel too hierarchical or rigid. So I joined for my field training, and that connection eventually led me to stay on as an intern, and then as a full-time employee."

          "qa4": {
            "q": "Have there been any moments when you felt, 'Ah, I’m really doing well at my job'?",
            "a": "Rather than feeling like I’m doing particularly well, I tend to feel proud whenever the company achieves progress — like when we secure new support projects or take meaningful steps forward as a team. It’s less of a self-congratulatory feeling and more of a reminder that there’s still a lot more I want to do, a kind of mixed emotion between satisfaction and motivation."

            "a": "Most people imagine climbing to the top of a company as their goal, but that’s not really me. My motto is ‘steady and long.’ I once thought about how I’d like to be like a fan — not as powerful as an air conditioner, but still something that quietly helps others. It’s a bit of a metaphor, but I want to be someone who’s helpful and reliable, even if not always in the spotlight. (Of course, that doesn’t mean I plan to stop working hard after one season!)"

            "a": "At first, I thought it was a slow train, but it turned out to be an express one. Still, if I had to describe Bigtablet, I’d say it’s a lot like the moon. Sometimes it feels so big and distant, yet it radiates this quiet beauty, like a soft halo in the night sky. It’s ever-changing and full of life. Like watching the moon through a high-speed camera — even when it’s momentarily hidden, it remains the brightest, most noticeable thing in the sky. Maybe ‘the North Star’ would be a more fitting comparison, but somehow, ‘the moon’ feels closer to my heart — because it’s something I hope will keep growing and shining brighter."

            "q": "Could you tell us a bit about your role at BigTablet?",
            "a": "As a PM, I’m responsible for performance management and supporting our development team. My main focus is to help developers stay fully immersed in their work by taking care of everything around them."

          "qa3": {
            "q": "The title ‘PM’ might sound unfamiliar to some. What exactly does a Product Manager do?",
            "a": "PM can mean many things, but in my case, it stands for Product Manager. A product manager is someone who constantly asks ‘why’—supporting the process of building better products that customers truly want. We connect different teams and ensure clear communication throughout development. In IT, that means coordinating with departments like planning, design, and development to define features and balance what customers want with what’s technically possible."

            "q": "I heard you graduated from a Meister high school. What made you decide to pursue a career in IT and become a PM?",
            "a": "Ever since I was young, I dreamed of entering society early. My motto has always been ‘walk a different path.’ So instead of going to college, I wanted to gain real-world experience as soon as possible. I’d always been interested in computers, so naturally I wanted to make that my profession. During my time at Meister High School, I studied web development for two years, but I realized that I truly enjoyed interacting with people and supporting projects across all areas. That’s when I decided to pursue the PM role."
          },
          "qa5": {
            "q": "What challenges have you faced while working as a PM?",
            "a": "There are many challenges, but automation is probably the hardest part. Automation is meant to make things more efficient, but sometimes the process itself feels inefficient or overly complicated. Still, once it’s properly set up, it can dramatically improve workflow. I often think deeply about how tasks should be structured so that my teammates can work more efficiently. That kind of problem-solving mindset has become a big part of how I approach my work."
          },
          "qa6": {
            "q": "Finally, what made you decide to join BigTablet, and what are your goals here?",
            "a": "Before joining BigTablet, I applied to several companies, but I often ran into obstacles like educational background and the tough job market. Since most PM roles require developer experience or internal transfers, it wasn’t easy for someone new like me. I wanted a freer, startup-style environment where I could experience everything from A to Z. So when BigTablet sent a job posting to my school, I was thrilled—it felt like destiny. I think the most valuable thing I want to achieve here is to grow together with the team. Startups evolve alongside their members, and that shared growth mirrors my own journey as a young professional. I want to keep learning and growing with BigTablet."

            "q": "You mentioned that you’re in charge of backend development — what exactly does a backend developer do?",
            "a": "Backend development involves working with the data and logic that users don’t see directly. I build and manage servers, databases, and deployment workflows. To explain it a bit more, backend developers handle everything that happens from the moment a user signs up — including logins, data communication, and even security — designing, developing, and maintaining the entire system that supports the service."

            "q": "You and Yerim both graduated from a Meister high school. What made you decide to pursue a career in development?",
            "a": "I’ve always been interested in IT, and since many people around me were developers, I naturally grew curious about the field. Initially, I studied to become an Android app developer, but after discovering backend development, I realized it suited me much better — and I really enjoyed it. So I shifted my focus to backend, which turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made. After entering Meister High School, I prepared to become a developer, and now I’m proudly part of BigTablet’s development team."

            "q": "What are some of the pros and cons you’ve experienced while working on the development team?",
            "a": "Since I joined in the early development stage, there were times when the basic infrastructure was lacking. Building things from scratch and learning new technologies at the same time was quite challenging. Documentation, in particular, was tough for me — as a developer used to coding, creating templates and writing technical documents while developing was a new experience. But through discussions and collaboration with teammates, I’ve been improving both technically and personally. It’s rewarding to see progress every day and to feel like I’m putting together a big puzzle piece by piece."

However, I’m very grateful for the support I receive from the company and the culture we’ve built — where everyone trusts and respects each other’s work. That positive environment makes it enjoyable to work here."

In the long run, I want to become a developer who can turn ideas into reality. While it’s easy to imagine things, bringing those ideas to life is the real challenge — and that’s the kind of developer I aspire to be."
